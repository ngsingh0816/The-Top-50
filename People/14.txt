Alexander the Great
Alexander, son of Phillip, conquered Greece and many other territories all under the age of 30 but did not live much longer after conquering these places because he died of unknown causes, which many people believe to be malaria. He spread Greek Hellenism to show his deep appreciation for Greek culture. He is influential because of how he unified almost all of the world and gave them something in common so trade was easier.
