Mahatmas Gandhi
Gandhi led India's revolution for independence against the British in the form of peaceful protest. He was one of the first ones to use it and showed that blood did not have to be shed to gain independence. However, shortly before gaining India's liberty, Gandhi was assassinated so he could never see all that he worked for to become a reality. Gandhi is influential because he fought for India's independence and brought a new form of protest that many people still use today.
