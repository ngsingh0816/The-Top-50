Jesus Christ
Jesus Christ is claimed to be the son of God according to Christians. However, at the time that he was alive, most people followed pagan rituals and killed all of the people who were not like them. Therefore Jesus was persecuted for saying that he was the son of God. Jesus was an influential person because he set the creation of Christianity into motion.
