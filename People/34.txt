Galileo Galilei
Galileo created the first telescope, which he used to confirm that the earth and the other planets rotated around the sun. He is considered the father of modern science because of his magnificent work in physics and astronomy. Galileo played a major role in the scientific revolution because when he thought the earth orbited around the sun, other people realized that they could be wrong about other things so they started to challenge their prior knowledge and gain new information. Galileo is influential because without him, the scientific revolution might not have happened and that would make society a lot less advanced technologically.
