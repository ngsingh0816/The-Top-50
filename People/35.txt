Isaac Newton
Isaac Newton proved that there is a force called gravity that always brings anything in the air down. Newton wrote of the most important scientific books called the Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy. He advanced the scientific revolution with his work on optics, mechanics, and gravitation. A common thing associated with Isaac Newton is how he was hit on the head with an apple and that is why he was inspired to study gravity. Newton is influential because he laid the foundation for many new scientific studies yet to come.
