Siddartha Guatama
Siddartha Guatama, or Buddha, was a Indian prince who noticed suffering all around him. As Guatama watch the peasants on the street stuffer, he couldn't help but asking himself why the lower classes were like this. He came up with the four noble truths, which were about how ordinary life is suffering, and from that came the eight fold path. All this together combined with a few other small parts formed a philosophy / religion called Buddhism. He is influential because he also single handedly started one of the most followed religions.
