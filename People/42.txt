Euclid
Euclid's advancements in geometry were vast, which is shown by what he did. Referred to as the Father of Geometry, Euclid was a mathematician who  created a book called Elements. In this book, Euclid worked on how to present data, the division of geometric figures, the mathematical theory of mirrors, and optics. Euclid is influential because he was the first to start studying what we now know as geometry.
