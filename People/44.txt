Nelson Mandela
Mandela was president of South Africa from 1994 to 1999, but he wasn't always respected that highly. He was sentenced to life in prison for leading an anti-apartheid group. But after twenty-seven years in jail, he was finally released. He created his own party to run for office and won from a representative democratic vote. Therefore, Nelson Mandela is influential because he help South Africa move towards representative democracy so that his country would have a less corrupt government and more rights.
