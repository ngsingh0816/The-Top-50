Christopher Columbus
Although what Christopher Columbus was trying to do failed, he did end up doing some good. Columbus wanted to get from Europe to India by traveling east around the globe. However, at that time, people thought that the world was flat and that he would just fall off. Columbus went east and instead of finding India, he found The New World. So he came back and told everybody about his experiences there and people thought he had successfully traveled around the world. Without the fear in their minds, more people started to explore the unknown regions of the world. Overall, Christopher Columbus was influential because he, almost single handedly, started globalization.
