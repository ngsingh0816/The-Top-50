Nicolaus Copernicus
Copernicus is famous for making the realization that the earth revolves around the sun. He discovered this in the early fifteen hundreds when he gave some of his friends a copy of his views on how the solar system was. After that, Nicolaus gathered data for some time until he published his book called De Revolutionibus Orbium Coelestium. Nicolaus Copernicus is influential because he was the first to try to prove that the sun was the center of the universe and because of that, more people challenged what they already knew, leading to more information being gained.
