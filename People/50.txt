Cyrus the Great
Cyrus the Great was a great leader of Persia who conquered many territories in his time. However, the difference between him and any other leader of an empire was that Cyrus treated all of his conquered people almost as well as Persians. They could vote, run in government, own land, and practice their own religion; all they had to do was pay some taxes. Cyrus the Great is influential because he was one of the first leaders to be peaceful to his conquered subjects.
