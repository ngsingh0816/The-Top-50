Prologue:When judging how influential somebody is, there are many standards that are taken into consideration.  Of these standards, the most important of them is the amount of change the individual as a result from their accomplishments alone.  However, the amount of change is a difficult thing to measure as it is affected by one's perspective and bias. I tried to eliminate all of my bias and see things from every side when adding the most influential people to my list. Anything having to do with religion deserved one of the higher spot on my list because religion dictates how many people live their lives. People who actually follow their religions sometimes pray five times a day and may eat different food. These change the way people live their lives because they take time out of their day to pray and they eat food, which they may or may not eat normally. After religion comes technology / science and changes in society, which are ranked almost equally. These are both important because without technology or science, work would not be able to get done quickly, leaving time for less advancement. Changes to society are also important because they change the way the common people live. This is why the enlightenment thinkers were so influential.  An example of a change to society would be the development or use of democracy. In Greece, it balanced the power of the aristocrats and the middle class, which helped to prevent a revolt and many other things.  After technology and society is culture, which is important because it makes different places different from one another. Without culture, the world would be the same and therefore less productive. This is because advancements come through challenging ideas, which is a result of conflict, which can be traced back to culture sometimes. Finally, after culture, comes philosophy, which is not on the top because although it is influential, it is often made up of ideas from many people. Still, philosophy is key in the progress of humans because it teaches people how to function and believe in what they want. It's more like a code of ethics that teach people how to live their lives. However, all of these qualities do not set the place of a person in stone nor do they tell how influential the people are. The items listed are more like guidelines and weights rather than categories into which people fall. Overall, the measure of how influential somebody is varies by how much change they cause.Credits:Pictures Courtesy of Google  ImagesMusic Courtesy of Apple's iTunes and YouTubeVideos Courtesy of YouTubeEverything else was created by Neil Singh
