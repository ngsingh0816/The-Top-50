Abraham
Abraham is noted to be the father of the big three religions: Christianity, Islam, and Judaism. He was said to be a prophet but we may never know for sure because currently, the world has no proof that Abraham ever existed. Whether or not he truly was alive, his non apparent existence still influenced many people by creating a starting point for some of the most followed religions during all of time.
