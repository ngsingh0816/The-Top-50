Muhammad
Muhammad is the founder of Islam and a prophet. He almost single handedly spread Islam through the middle eastern parts of the world as he traveled between Mecca and Medina. Muhammad is highly respected among fellow his Muslims and created a basis for his religion based on what Abraham (see #1) did. Muhammad is very influential because he practically created one of the most followed religions all by himself.
