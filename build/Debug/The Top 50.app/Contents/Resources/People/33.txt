Martin Luther
Martin Luther helped to split the Christian Church. He realized that many church officials were being unjust in their judgement so he decided to protest against the church. If not for Johannes Gutenberg and the invention of the printing press, Martin Luther might not have been able to spread his message, but nevertheless, Martin Luther successfully reached other people's minds and remains influential.
