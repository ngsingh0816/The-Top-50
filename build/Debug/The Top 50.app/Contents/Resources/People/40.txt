John Dalton
Dalton was an English chemist who worked on the development of the modern atomic theory where there are small particles called atoms that make up matter. Although he was wrong about a few things, he could not experiment with any of the stuff he was talking about at his time, so he was amazingly close with his assumptions. Apart from his atomic theory, Dalton studied gases and how temperature affected a gas. John Dalton was very influential because he started the building blocks of chemistry with his atomic theory.
