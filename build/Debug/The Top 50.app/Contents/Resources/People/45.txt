Aristotle
Aristotle was the student of Plato and the teacher of Alexander the Great. He wrote about many subjects such as physics, poetry, music, logic, politics, government, and biology. He laid the base for many of the subjects he studied although many of them were eventually replaced. However many of these replacements did not occur until the 19th century. That means that his teachings were so advanced that they could not be challenged at other time periods. Aristotle was influential because he help form basic physics and logic.
