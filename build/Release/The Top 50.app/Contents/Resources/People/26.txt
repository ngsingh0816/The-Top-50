Charles Darwin
Darwin's theory of natural selection and evolution was a gigantic boom in biology. However the church opposed his research, but with Darwin's overwhelming research, he was able to convince most of the people during his time that evolution was true. Charles Darwin is influential because he made people think about how humans were formed other than religion and he opposed the church, which hinted towards how religion wasn't always right.
