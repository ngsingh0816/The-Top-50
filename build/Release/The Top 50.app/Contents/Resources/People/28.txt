Henry Ford
Ford revolutionized transportation and manufacturing with creating cheap, affordable, usable cars by utilizing the assembly line. Without Henry Ford, cars would only be available to the rich and they would barely be of any use because of how the parts were made. Even more so, any other form of machinery would be more expensive because Henry Ford also used the idea of interchangeable parts so he could inexpensively replace old or broken components of a product that he made. Overall, Henry Ford is influential because he automated the production of machines.
