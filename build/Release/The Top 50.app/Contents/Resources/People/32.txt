Socrates
Socrates developed the Socratic Method, which told people to challenge what they already knew. This was a major cause of all of the great knowledge attained during Greek times. People thought the earth was flat, but when they challenged it, they realized that the earth could not be flat. Therefore, Socrates is influential because he challenged people to learn more.
