Pope Urban II
This pope officially created the Crusades. He wanted to take land form the Muslims so he created a way to do that; he told people that they would be freed of their sins and have a good life if they fought in the Crusades. Because of the Crusades, many battles were fought and many people were killed. In addition to that, it intensified conflicts between the Christians and the Muslims, which is still evident today. Pope Urban II is influential because he was one of the first people to deliberately start religious conflicts.
