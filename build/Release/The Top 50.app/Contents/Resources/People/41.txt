Plato
Plato was a student of Socrates and the teacher of Aristotle. He studied many subjects such as philosophy, logic, ethos, rhetoric, the art of using language to create a persuasive effect, and math. He, along with Socrates, challenged the ideas he was told. He founded the Academy of Athens, which was the place where the greatest masterminds of that time came together to learn and share ideas. Overall, Plato was influential because he created a great school in which other people could learn and taught Aristotle everything he knew.
