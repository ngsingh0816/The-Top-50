Charles Babbage
Babbage is commonly referred to as the Father of the Computer. He invented the first basic computer and more complex designs were created of his model. What he basically tried to do was make a simple calculator. He found that asking humans to compute numbers had a high risk of error, so he thought he would try to make numbers computed mechanically so there would be no error. Eventually his design was created in the 19th century and was a much better computer than the average, modern calculator. Overall, Charles Babbage was influential because he created the designs for the first computer.
