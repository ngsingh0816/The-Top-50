Johannes Gutenberg
Johannes is responsible for creating the printing press, which allowed text to be written down faster than ever before. Before the printing press, one would have to hand write everything they wanted down, but after, all they had to do was set the blocks in place and let the machine do its work. Because of the printing press, books were manufactured in bigger quantities so education was much cheaper. Johannes influenced almost everybody who used a book with his invention.
