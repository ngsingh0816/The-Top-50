Mr. Wire
Mr. Wire is my hero and the 51st most influential man in the world. He has taught many young students about bias and information that they will never forget in their lives. He used many experiments to make his students understand the concepts that they were learning in class and he was Athlete of the Year back while he was still in school. Mr. Wire is influential because he sculpted the minds of young individuals.
